Overlay Concept
===================

The Xilinx速 Zynq速 All Programmable device is an SOC based on a dual-core ARM速 Cortex速-A9 processor (referred to as the  *Processing System* or **PS**), which also includes FPGA fabric (referred to as  *Programmable Logic* or **PL**). The ARM SoC subsystem also includes a number of dedicated peripherals (memory controllers, USB, Uart, IIC, SPI etc).

The FPGA fabric is reconfigurable, and can be used to implement high performance functions in hardware. However, FPGA design is a specialized task which requires deep hardware engineering knowledge and expertise. 
Overlays, or hardware libraries, are programmable/configurable FPGA designs that extend the user application from the Processing System of the Zynq into the Programmable Logic. This allows software programmers to take advantage of the FPGA fabric to accelerate an application, or to use an overlay to customize the hardware platform for a particular application.

For example, image processing is a typical application where the FPGAs can provide acceleration. A software programmer can use a hardware library to run some of the image processing functions (e.g. edge detect, thresholding etc.) on the FPGA fabric. 
Hardware libraries can be loaded to the FPGA dynamically, as required, just like a software library.
Using Pynq, separate image processing functions could be implemented in different overlays and loaded from Python on demand.
 
To give another example, the PYNQ-Z1 has more pins/interfaces available than a typical embedded platform, and can implement multiple custom processors in the Programmable logic. 
Multiple sensor and actuator controllers, and multiple heterogeneous custom processors (real-time or non real-time), could be implemented in hardware in the new overlay, and connected to the available pins. A software programmer could use the controllers and processors in the overlay through a Pynq API.   

Base Overlay
===================

The base overlay is a precompiled P design that can be downloaded to the Programmable Logic. It is the default overlay included with the PYNQ-Z1 image, and is automatically loaded when the system boots. 

This overlay includes the follwoing hardware:
* HDMI In
* HDMI Out
* Mic in 
* Audio out
* User LEDs, Switches, Pushbuttons
* 2x PMOD IOP
* Arduino IOP
* Tracebuffer


 the Programmable Logic to connect HDMI In and Out controllers, an audio controller (Mic In and Audio Out), and the Pmod and Arduino interfaces (through the IO Processors) to the PS. This allows the peripherals to be used from the Pynq environment.

HDMI 
============= 
The PYNQ-Z1 does not contain external HDMI circutry. The Zynq pins are connected directly to the HDMI interfaces.

Both HDMI interfaces are connected to DDR memory. Video can be streamed from the HDMI in to memory, and from memory to HDMI out. This allows processing of Video data from python, or writing a Video stream, or image in Python and sending it to the HDMI out. 

Note that Jupyter notebook supports embedded video. However, video captured from the HDMI will be in raw format and would not be suitable for playback in a notebook without appropriate encoding. 

HDMI In
^^^^^^^^^^^^
HDMI in supports the following resolutions:

HDMI Out
^^^^^^^^^^^^
The HDMI out IP supports the following resolutions:

* 640x480  
* 800x600 
* 1024x768  
* 1280x1024
* 1920x1080


Mic in 
==================
The mic on the board is connected directly to the Zynq PL pins. i.e. the board does not have an audio codec. The audio data is captured in PDM format.

Audio out
==================
The audio out IP is PWM driven mono.

User IO
=============
The PYNQ-Z1 board includes two tri-color LEDs, 2 switches, 4 push buttons, and 4 individual LEDs. In the base overlay, the user IO is connected directly to the PS. 


IOPs
============
IOPs are dedicated IO processor subsystems that allow peripherals with different IO standards to be connected to the system on demand. This allows a software programmer to use a wide range of peripherals with different interfaces and protocols without needing to create a new FPGA design for each peripheral or set of peripherals. 

PMOD IOPs
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Each Pmod port is connected to its own Pmod IOP. 

Arduino IOP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Arduino interface is connected to the Arduino IOP. The chipkit pins are also available to the Arduino IOP. 


Tracebuffer
=================

There is a tracebuffer connected to the Pmod, and Arduino interfaces. The tracebuffer is connected directly to the DDR. The tracebuffer can trace data on the interfaces and stream it back to DDR memory for analysis in Python.
