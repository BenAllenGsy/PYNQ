Introduction
==================

MMIO
======
MMIO can be used to map PL memory to allow data to be read/written from Python. This is a simple way to transfer data, and is most appropriate for small amounts of data, as the performance will be relatively slow. Each Python command will transfer 32 bits of data. 

Example performance
---------------------

Transfer 32 bits in a loop
